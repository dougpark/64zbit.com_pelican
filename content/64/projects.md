I've been doing this for decades and now I want to be an HTML5 game devloper. I'm starting with a server! Well, I have very little experience with game development, graphics, animation, sound, so it's going to be a fun journey.

Stories in the pipeline:

-   VSCode Remote
-   Installing Docker, Docker-Compose
-   Nodejs with socket.io
-   Nodemon sounds like Pokemon, yep!
-   SSL and Letsencrypt certificates
-   Working with Apache, MySQL and PHP
-   Hosting your own VPS backend with Linode for $5 a month
-   HTML5 games and AJAX are best buds
-   HTML5 games and socket.io are even better buds
