Summary:  Manton Reece and Brent Simmons — have noticed that JSON has become the developers’ choice for APIs, and that developers will often go out of their way to avoid XML. JSON is simpler to read and write, and it’s less prone to bugs.

# JSON Feed

I ran across this today and liked the idea so I added it to this Pelican site thanks to Andrew Heiss and his JSONFeed Pelican plug-in. [GitHub - andrewheiss/pelican_json_feed: Pelican plugin to add a JSON Feed file to your site](https://github.com/andrewheiss/pelican_json_feed)

 Manton Reece and Brent Simmons — have noticed that JSON has become the developers’ choice for APIs, and that developers will often go out of their way to avoid XML. JSON is simpler to read and write, and it’s less prone to bugs.

 So we developed JSON Feed, a format similar to RSS and Atom but in JSON. It reflects the lessons learned from our years of work reading and publishing feeds.
