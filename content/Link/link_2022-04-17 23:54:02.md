Summary: Autofocus Variations Can Ruin Your Focus Accuracy

> Autofocus Variations Can Ruin Your Focus Accuracy
> Whilst the autofocus has been improved with successive generations of the camera is still relies upon contrast detection to set the focus point.
> So the camera moves the lens to the point of maximum contrast and then steps forwards and backwards to get the precise point.
> Because of mechanical tolerances in the focus mechanism sometimes the repeatability of the focus point is questionable.
> I noticed some of my shots were not exactly sharp at the pinpoint area that I knew I had set the camera to when I took the shot.
> So I set up my DSLR focus chart used to correct the optical viewfinder to sensor calibration and shot a series of 10 images in AF single area and smallest target size. There was a noticeable shift in a lot of the images as you can see from the resulting images. Compare that to the same target where I manually set the focus point.
