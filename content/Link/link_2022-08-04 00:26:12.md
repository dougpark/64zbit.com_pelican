Summary: I visited the Compliant Mechanisms Research group at Brigham Young University and spoke to Professor Larry Howell:

> At the above link, you can download 3D-print files to make some of the objects in the video, plus learn more about compliant mechanisms.
> 
> What I learned about compliant mechanisms I summarize in the 8 P's of compliant mechanisms:
> 
> 1. Part count (reduced by having flexible parts instead of springs, hinges)
> 2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)
> 3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)
> 4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)
> 5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)
> 6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)
> 7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)
> 8. Predictability (devices are reliable over a long period of time)
