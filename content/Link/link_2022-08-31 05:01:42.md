Summary: A Docker-based Dev Environment

> A Docker-based Dev Environment
> The dev environment I wish to build will be based on Linux. Frequently, I wish to quickly spin up a Linux environment for fun and dev. Although a VM is awesome, I want something lighter, something that spins up instantly at almost zero cost. And I want something that, if I left it running, I wouldn't even notice.
> 
> Docker images always start from a base image. The reason I picked Linux is because Linux comes with the most stripped-down bare-bones starter image. This means that all of the images I build on top of it will be light too, and I get to pick exactly what I want.
