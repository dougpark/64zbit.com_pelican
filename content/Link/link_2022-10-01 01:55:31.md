Summary: How to install Ansible

> How to install Ansible
> 
> Because Ansible is found in the standard repositories, the installation is as simple as logging in to your controller node and issuing the command:
> 
> sudo apt-get install ansible -y
> 
> The installation will pick up a large number of dependencies and will take anywhere from 2-10 minutes to complete.
> 
> We’ll also need to install a second piece of software, called SSHpass, which is a non-interactive password provider — otherwise you’d have trouble with SSH authentication. Install SSHPass with:
> 
> sudo apt-get install sshpass -y
