Summary: Open Token and Secret Key

> Open Token and Secret Key
>

> 
> In SwitchBot API v1.1, the authentication method has been improved. In order to gain access to private data through the API, you must generate a unique signature using a token and a secret key. When you make a request, the Authorization token and signature will be validated simultaneously.
> 
> You as a developer will then be able to add, delete, edit, and look up your data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to your SwitchBot account.

> How to Sign?

> 
> Print the 13 digit timestamp and concatenate it with your token
> Create a signature using your secret and the string produced in the previous step
> Convert the signature to upper case
