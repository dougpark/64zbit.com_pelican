Summary: The Threading Module

> The Threading Module
> The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.
> 
> The threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods −
> 
> threading.activeCount() − Returns the number of thread objects that are active.
> threading.currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.
> threading.enumerate() − Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.
> In addition to the methods, the threading module has the Thread class that implements threading. The methods provided by the Thread class are as follows −
> 
> run() − The run() method is the entry point for a thread.
> start() − The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.
> join([time]) − The join() waits for threads to terminate.
> isAlive() − The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.
> getName() − The getName() method returns the name of a thread.
> setName() − The setName() method sets the name of a thread.
> Creating Thread Using Threading Module
> To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following −
> 
> Define a new subclass of the Thread class.
> Override the __init__(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.
> Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.
> Once you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the start(), which in turn calls run() method.
