> # It utilizes the Unicorn CPU emulator converted
> # to Javascript by Unicorn.js in order to run MicroPython
> # "bare metal" on an ARM CPU emulation.
> 
> # MicroPython on Unicorn is completely open source so 
> # make sure to report bugs to the issue tracker!.

> # The user and reset buttons along with the LEDs and pins
> # on the pyboard below are fully functional. Unfortunately
> # that's not quite the case for the clock speed approximation
> # when delayed.
> 
> # Try to write a script, paste some code or run a demo!
