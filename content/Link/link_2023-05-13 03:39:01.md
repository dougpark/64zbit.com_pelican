> Implement DNS in a weekend
> 
> Hello! Our goal here is to implement a toy DNS resolver.
> 
> What’s a DNS resolver? It’s a program that knows how to figure out what the IP address for a domain is. Here’s what the command line interface of the resolver we’re going to write looks like:
> 
> $ python3 resolve.py example.com
> 93.184.216.34
> 
> The whole thing is about 200 lines of Python, including implementing all of the binary DNS parsing from scratch.
> 
> This project is a fun way to learn:
> 
> How to parse a binary network protocol like DNS
> How DNS works under the hood (what’s happening behind the scenes when you make a DNS query?)
> There are also some bonus exercises if you want to implement a few more of the features a real DNS resolver would have.
> 
> Everything is in a Jupyter notebook, which you can download and run. You can download all the code here:
