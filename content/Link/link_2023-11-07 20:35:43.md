> Whether you're developing or using a web component in any framework, you need to work with the DOM at a certain level. Knowing the browser DOM APIs and how to use them is crucial to web development. A website that introduces the APIs, highlights common problems, and provides answers to popular questions can be incredibly useful.
> That's why I've put together this collection of resources:
> No external libraries, just native browser APIs
> Small, easy-to-understand examples
> Live demos
> Tips and best practices included
> Real-life use cases
> Works with modern browsers and even supports Internet Explorer
> Get ready to master DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
