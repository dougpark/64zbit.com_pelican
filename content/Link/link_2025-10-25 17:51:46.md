Summary: Nike’s new “neuroscience-based footwear” is designed to activate an athlete’s brain before and after a big game. The two shoes, a mule (the $95 Mind 001) and a lace-up sneaker (the $145 Mind 002), feature a distinctive array of 22 orange foam nodes embedded in each sole. Nike says the nodes each move up and down independently, like “pistons and gimbals,” as the athlete walks, mimicking the feeling of walking on the ground in a way that is “scientifically shown” to stimulate the foot and thus activate the brain’s sensory areas.
