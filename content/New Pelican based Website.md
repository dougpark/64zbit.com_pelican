It's been in the works for awhile, but today I updated my production server settings to show the new website based on the Pelican static site generator.

I tried to follow the same look and feel of the Ghost based server but with a fully customizable template. With Ghost I was limited to using their default template and never wanted to learn how to change it. With the new Pelican based site it is super easy to make all the modifications I want.
