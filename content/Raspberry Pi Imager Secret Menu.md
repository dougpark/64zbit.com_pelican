The [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software) is a great piece of software for preparing your **SD cards** for use with Raspberry Pis. However, if youâ€™re setting up a number of Raspberry Pis you will find that you still need to connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse to them to complete the setup, to:

-   update the **wifi ssid** and **password**
-   change the **hostname** and **default password**
-   change **localization** settings

There is another, better alternative to doing those 3 steps - use the Raspberry Pi Imager secret menu.
