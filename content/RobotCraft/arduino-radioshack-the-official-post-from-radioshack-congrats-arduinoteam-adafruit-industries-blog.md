We were overwhelmed with the response, and [promised to bring in a top list](http://blog.radioshack.com/2011/07/21/top-ten-diy-suggestions-from-you/#more-520 "Top Ten DIY Suggestions From You"){target="_blank"} of suggestions from you – including Arduino.

Now you can easily find a RadioShack store and get the parts you need to finish that awesome project, instead of having to order it online and wait.

It connects to the computer with a standard USB cable and contains everything else you need to program and use the board. It can be extended with a variety of shields: custom daughter-boards with specific features.
> > -   **Arduino Mega 2560 REV3 (2760127):** The version of the Mega released with the Uno, this version features the Atmega2560, which has twice the memory.

Now this is the Radio Shack I remember from the late 80's. Hope this works for them. Go out and buy something. You owe it to yourself to make something today!
