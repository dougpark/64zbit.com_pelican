Disassembling the Dash On Thursday I got an email from Amazon saying I had been selected to try out two Dash buttons at zero cost. To be honest it as kind of surprising given that although we order from them plenty, I can’t say that we regularly stock up on consumables from Amazon: they suggested I get the Gillette razor button, something I’ve ordered twice. Maybe it’s a ploy to try and get me to order more regularly from them. Maybe it’s because I’m in New York and they are trying to get more density in Manhattan. Maybe they read my blog. Who knows but in any case it’s free hardware. The functionality is simple enough: click a button, get the Dash item at your door. But what makes it tick? Like any good hardware nerd, I was excited to find out.
