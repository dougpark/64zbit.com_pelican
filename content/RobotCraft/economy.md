Robots are doing more and more human jobs. We need a plan on how the majority of humans will survive when there is no work for them to do. How do we need to change our economy so that everyone benefits from the work robots are doing, not just the few that control all the robots. Should taxes be collected and the benefits shared with everyone? Think about the control the few companies that manage the robots will have.Â 

How worthless will we all feel, what will keep us entertained?
