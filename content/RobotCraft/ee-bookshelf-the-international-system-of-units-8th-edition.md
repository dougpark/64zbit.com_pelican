Have you ever wondered what the official SI unit for magnetic field strength is (hint: ampere per metre), or maybe kinematic viscosity (square metre per second), or perhaps the correct abbreviations or symbols for some specific SI unit or value?  The Bible of SI Units, [The International System of Units, 8th Edition](http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/){target="_blank"}, has all the (very official) answers and can be downloaded in PDF format in English or French from the website of the [Bureau International des Poids et Mesures](http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/){target="_blank"}.  It’s actually just kind of find reading through one of the most important changes in recent scientific history, but it’s particularly useful in a world where there is still a lot of confusion over which units and scale are appropriate to use and when, and how to properly cite them!
