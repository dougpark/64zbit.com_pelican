In fact, each student's entire educational career will hinge on Apple's revolutionary tablet device.

Scheduled to open this August, the so-called "Steve Jobs Schools" will host about 1,000 children, aged four to 12. According to Spiegel Online, the curriculum will be largely student-directed. Gone will be typical education tools like lesson plans, schedules, grades and parent-teacher meetings.

The school day will be atypical as well. While each participating school will be open from 7:30 AM to 6:30 PM each workday, students will only be required to attend between 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM. Also, parents will be encouraged to take vacations as it suits their own schedules.

Gertjan Kleinpaste, the principal of a participating school in Rotterdam, understands that the program will be envied by some and reviled by others. It's certainly a bold educational experiment. I'm quite interested to see how this pans out.
