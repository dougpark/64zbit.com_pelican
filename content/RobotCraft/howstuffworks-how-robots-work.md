On the most basic level, human beings are made up of five major components:

A body structure  
A muscle system to move the body structureÂ   
A sensory system that receives information about the body and the surrounding environment  
A power source to activate the muscles and sensors  
A brain system that processes sensory information and tells the muscles what to do
