I’m a big Apple fan and I have lots of Apple products and the real problem is that iOS is boring. Tim Cook is known for efficiency and Jonathan Ive loves his basic looks, however, when combined they are boring! iOS used to have lots of little details that were exciting to find, but now they are hard to find, hard to discover, and boring when found. They need to let their developers have a little fun, stay in their human guidelines of course, but still have a little fun. Hardware optimization makes sense, but don’t over optimize the software. It can provide a path to fun.
