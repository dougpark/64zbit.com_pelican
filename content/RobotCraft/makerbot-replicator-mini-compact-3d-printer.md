**New Leading-Edge Printers**

At MakerBot, we’ve been making professional-quality 3D printers affordable and accessible since 2009. In that short time we’ve released four generations of 3D printers, helping unleash a worldwide 3D printing revolution in art and design, engineering and manufacturing, architecture, education, and more.

Today we’re yet again defining the new standard in ease of use, quality, and reliability with the introduction of *three* new MakerBot Replicator 3D printers. We are proud to introduce the:

**– MakerBot Replicator Mini Compact 3D Printer**

**– MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3D Printer**

**– MakerBot Replicator Z18 3D Printer**

**The MakerBot Replicator 3D Printing Platform**  
All three Fifth Generation MakerBot Replicator 3D Printers run on a common MakerBot Replicator 3D Printing Platform, which enables improved reliability, ease of use, and seamless connectivity.
