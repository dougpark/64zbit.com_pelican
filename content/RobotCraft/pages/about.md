I graduated from McMurry University in 1987 with a major in computer science and a minor in psychology. I've worked in the manufacturing industry, the health care industry, the insurance industry, the finance industry and the engineering industry. I've worked on projects with IBM, Lockheed Martin, Sandia National Labs, Microsoft, Intel, SGI and other national and international companies. I no longer lead enterprise software teams, but I follow most of the industry trends. My hobbies include - helping kids learn about robotics and taking pictures.
