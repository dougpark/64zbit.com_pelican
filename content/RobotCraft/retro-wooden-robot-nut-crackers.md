Matthias Zschaler designed two retro-styled wooden [Nut Crackers](http://www.suck.uk.com/products/robot-nut-cracker/) for [SUCK UK](http://www.suck.uk.com) that look like robots. To operate them, the nut goes in the robot’s tummy and the key is turned to crack open the shell. They are [available to purchase](http://www.suck.uk.com/products/robot-nut-cracker/) at SUCK UK.

> …Robot Nut Crackers are easy to use and will break into any nut, from the smallest hazelnut to the toughest walnut. Your new best friend is made from solid beech wood and finished with a gleaming retro paint-job.
