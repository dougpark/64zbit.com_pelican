[‘We Hardly Understand Anything’: Rodney Brooks On Artificial Intelligence \| Radio Boston](http://radioboston.wbur.org/2016/06/01/rodney-brooks)

If you’re going to talk about robots, there’s no better person to talk with than Rodney Brooks. He’s the former director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He’s also co-founder of two companies: iRobot, maker of the Roomba, and now Rethink Robotics.

He’s spent his entire life thinking about robots and artificial intelligence. He sat down with us to talk how he built his first machine, what technology we have yet to tackle and why Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are wrong to fear the future of robots.
