It is like swimming. If you can’t swim, you won’t be having any fun at all. Swimming sucks if all you do is float (or even sink) and fight the water. But boy, if you figure out the technique and glide through the water, it is incredible. But you don’t learn swimming by aiming for ease and fun. You learn to swim by aiming to be fast and graceful.


- In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take
- If we all do all that we can do then great things will happen
- Quote John S. - “I’m experiencing a narrowing of the possibility space due to aging.”

School Success

I think kids’ school success comes down to this in this order:

1. Homelife
2. Sleep
- Diet
4. Exercise
5. Teachers
6. Tech
7. School Year Length
8. Homework

What many seem to think:

1. School Year Length
2. Homework
3. Teachers
4. Tech
5. Homelife
6. Exercise 
7. Sleep
8. Diet
