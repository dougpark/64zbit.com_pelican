# About Me

Hi, I’m Doug Park — a lifelong technologist, problem-solver, and mentor. While I’m now retired, my curiosity and love for learning remain as active as ever.

Over the course of a 30+ year career in the technology field, I had the opportunity to work across a wide range of industries — from aerospace and manufacturing to healthcare, insurance, and finance. I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology from McMurry University, and that unique combination served me well. While computer science launched my career, it was often my understanding of people that made the real difference — especially in translating between technical and business teams.

I began at General Dynamics as a Manufacturing Technology Engineer, where I explored early applications of knowledge-based systems in factory settings. Later, at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, I led enterprise-level software architecture projects supporting engineering and logistics efforts for programs like the Joint Strike Fighter. In 2000, I was honored to lead the Engineering Team of the Month for demonstrating advanced prognostics and health management technologies.

Over the years, I became known as the “translator” or “firefighter” — someone who could bring clarity and direction to complicated or cross-disciplinary projects. I’ve always been drawn to the challenge of aligning systems and people, and I valued mentoring others just as much as solving technical problems.

But life changed direction in 2006 when my eight-year-old son was diagnosed with cancer. That experience reshaped my priorities. I stepped back from corporate leadership to focus on family, community, and causes that matter — especially those that invest in children.

Since then, I’ve poured my energy into helping the next generation learn, grow, and lead. I created hands-on STEM programs for local schools, served as a leader in the Boy Scouts, and have supported local organizations like the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. My commitment to giving back led me to Cook Children’s Medical Center, where I became a founding member of the Family Advisory Council and later served on the Institutional Review Board (IRB) to help guide ethical research involving children.

Today, I still enjoy exploring technology — just without the deadlines. I write, mentor, and occasionally tinker with home projects for the fun of learning. I also continue to support youth education and medical advocacy, which I consider some of the most important work of my life.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope my blog offers you something useful — whether it’s a tech insight, a project idea, or a spark of inspiration.

— Doug
