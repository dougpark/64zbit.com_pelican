Here’s a small demo game built with Phaser, used to test how Phaser games can be embedded directly in blog posts.

In this simple game, you control a car using only the left and right arrow keys. The goal? Navigate to the end of the road without crashing. No bells and whistles — just a quick test to prove the concept.

Go ahead and give it a try! It opens in a new tab for a cleaner, full-page experience.
