Here’s a small demo game built with Phaser, used to test how Phaser games can be embedded directly in blog posts.

In this simple game, you click the cirlce and it shows how fast your response time is. No bells and whistles — just a quick test to prove the concept.

Go ahead and give it a try! It opens in a new tab for a cleaner, full-page experience.
